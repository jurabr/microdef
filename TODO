TO DO:

- kernel:
  incorrect stiffness matrix of element o--| (don't see any mistake in code...)

- gfx:
  incorrect grid after change (probably faulty computation of pixels)
  symbols for nonzero displacements
  deformed structure
  load is sometimes auto-deleted
  indication of type of shown results

- terminals:
  wxWidgets?
  ...

- gui:
  menu for result sizes
  kind of status bar

- outputs:

- cli:
  command-line solver/postprocessor

- documentation

- fix usage of terminals (file handling etc.)



FIXED:

- outputs:
  text, LaTeX
- gui: 
  file name is shown in titlebar
- gfx:	
  invert symbols for tranverse load (or do changes in kernel?)
- kernel:  
  incorrect normal forces?!
  incorrect non-rectangle loads?!
- gfx:
  deformed ends of structure
- terminals:
  postscript
  gd
- outputs:
  images (PS, PNG)
- edit:
  nodes
  elements
- fix crazy resizing code
- size info for N,V,M results
- fix LC_NUMERIC problem for Gtk+
- create:
  boundary conditions
  forces
  loads on elements (2x)
- gfx:
  symbols of o--| and |--o elements
  symbols for forces
  symbols for element loads
- gui:
  menu system
- delete:
  nodes
  elements
  boundary conditions
  forces
  loads on elements
- I/O - test for empty file
- solver: test and fix it
- gfx
  symbols for forces
  symbols for element loads
- gui:
  dialog after solution
